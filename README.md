# Date Counter App

This is a small project demonstrating the use of the `useState` hook, conditional rendering, and event listeners in React. It's built with HTML, JSX, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

This application focuses on core React concepts:

*   **`useState` Hook:** Manages the application's state, such as the current date or any counter values.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Dynamically displays content based on the application's state (e.g., showing a calculated date only when it's available).
*   **Event Handling:** Uses event listeners to trigger state updates and re-renders the UI (e.g., button clicks to increment/decrement a counter or calculate a new date).

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **JSX:** A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Key Features Demonstrated

*   Updating the UI based on user interactions (e.g., button clicks, input changes).
*   Conditionally rendering content based on the application's state.
*   Basic event handling with event listeners.
*   Date calculations (adding or subtracting days from a given date).
